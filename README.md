# TodoList_nodejs
## Simple todo list created using Nodejs with Express.


First Nodejs web application that I've built, and the first time using Javascript extensively. It simply takes user input from the input field adds it to a mongo db. The page then reloads when the AJAX GET request is succeeds. 

Clicking on the items on the todo list will use an AJAX DELETE call that will delete the entry from the mongo db.
